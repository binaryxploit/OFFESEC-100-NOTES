# Summary
- Linux is the core part of an operating system (the kernel), not a complete operating system on its own.
- Different Linux distributions serve different purposes, from general use to specialized tasks like security or server management.
- Kali Linux is a security-focused distribution, ideal for penetration testing and cybersecurity tasks, and comes with a lot of pre-installed security tools.

# The History of Linux
- The Linux operating system began when a Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, wanted to create his own version of an operating system. He started working on the Linux kernel, the core part of the system, which helps manage hardware, memory, tasks, and communications between different parts of the computer.

- Linux is based on Unix, a popular operating system from the 1970s and 1980s. Another system that influenced Linux was Minix, a Unix-like system made for teaching. While Minix used a microkernel (where different parts of the system run separately), Torvalds chose a monolithic kernel (where everything runs in one process).
- At the same time, the GNU project was working on creating a free, Unix-like operating system. When Linux became ready faster than expected, the GNU project decided to use Linux as its kernel, and that's why we sometimes refer to Linux as GNU/Linux.

# What is Linux?
- Although the term Linux is often used to refer to entire operating systems, it technically refers only to the kernel, the core part of the system. This kernel is used by different Linux-based operating systems, known as distributions or distros.
- A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built using the Linux kernel, along with additional software like system utilities, desktop environments, and applications. Without these extra components, the Linux kernel on its own is like a car engine without the rest of the car.

# Different Types of Linux Distributions
There are many different Linux distributions, each designed for specific tasks or users. For example:
- Some are optimized for servers, while others are better for desktop use.
- Some are made for security, while others focus on usability or portability.
- Some are designed for enterprise or home users, or are specific to certain hardware platforms.

Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, SUSE, Android, and Kali Linux. Each distribution may have a standard release cycle or be a rolling release (where updates are continuous).

# Kali Linux
- Kali Linux is a special distribution of Linux created for security research and penetration testing. It comes with a wide range of tools for tasks like hacking, vulnerability testing, and forensics. Kali is based on Debian and was created by Offensive Security in 2013.

- Kali Linux is popular among security professionals because it has all the tools needed for tasks like:
	- Information gathering
	- Vulnerability analysis
	- Wireless attacks
	- Web application attacks
	- Password cracking
	- Hardware hacking
